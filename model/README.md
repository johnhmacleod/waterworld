This folder contains details of the model

This biggest issue we had was to ensure that the model did not overflow.  The 2nd & 3rd troughs we to small & should have been higher (not lower) than the previous one to mimimise potential for overflow.

I think I would also separate the flows for the pH and the flow meters so that we could recirculate the unpoluted water using a small pnd pump & only discard the water to which we added the vinegar to move the pH for the demo.  This would also remove the biggest challenge which was the need for fairly vigourous flow through the flow sensors and the potential for introducing air bubbles into that circuit which upset the flow meters!

It's definitely worth thoroughly dry running (well, you know what I mean!!) the proposed waster circuits before constructing them into the model.  The model, as delivered by the staging company leaked like a seive and was a challenge to control without either overflowing or introducing air.
